{"name":"googleapps-message-recall","tagline":"Recall Email in Google Apps Domains","body":"**Welcome to googleapps-message-recall for Google Apps Admins.**\r\n\r\nThe googleapps-message-recall software is an application to be hosted on\r\nGoogle AppEngine for recalling messages within a Google Apps domain.\r\n\r\nAs Enterprises move to the Cloud, requirements to match pre-Cloud service\r\ncapabilities follow. One key request from Enterprises of any size has been the\r\nability to administratively remove an Email from all users in the domain. The\r\nreasoning for such a request could be for Human Resource, Financial, or\r\nSecurity reasons. Typically, the mail systems the Enterprises moved from had\r\ncapabilities to perform this type of *“message recall”*. This functionality does\r\nnot exist in Google Apps today.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this software will be to provide similar functionality given the\r\ncapabilities that exist today for domains to interact with their users\r\nmailboxes in a scalable way using Google Cloud services.\r\n\r\nSee the [README](https://github.com/google/googleapps-message-recall/blob/master/README.md) file for more information about the scripts and a link to our support group. Check the [INSTALL-MESSAGE-RECALL pdf file](https://github.com/google/googleapps-message-recall/blob/master/INSTALL-MESSAGE-RECALL.pdf) for help installing and running the application.","google":"UA-25706479-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
